## Plugin

This plugin requires [Apitte/Core](https://github.com/apitte/core) library.

At first you have to register the main extension.

```yaml
extensions:
    api: Apitte\Core\DI\ApiExtension
```

Secondly, add the `NegotiationPlugin` plugin.

```yaml
api:
    plugins:
        Apitte\Negotiation\DI\NegotiationPlugin:
```

## Configuration

You can configure a few options.

```
api:
    plugins: 
        Apitte\Negotiation\DI\NegotiationPlugin:
            unification: false
```

- `unification` - Change default `JsonTransformer` to `JsonUnifyTransform`. You will see in next chapter.

## Negotiation

This plugin adds new features. They are called decorators, negotiators and transformers.

Basically, decorator listen on specific event and can modify incoming request or outgoing response directly or via negotiator.
The negotiator has the handling logic, if request has an appropriate extension or header and call the transformer.
All modifications (transforming data from A to B) is done in transformer, e.q. transform array to json.

### Decorators

There is single predefined decorator:

- `ResponseEntityDecorator` - It listens on 2 events, after dispatching and after exception. It means this decorator is triggered when the response is returned from controller
or if some exception is thrown.

### Negotiators

The main goal of the negotiator is determine if given request/response apply all conditions and call the transformer.

There are 3 predefined transformers:

- `SuffixNegotiator` - It's called if the URI ends with the given suffix, e.q `example.com/users.json` -> `json`.

- `DefaultNegotiator` - It's called when the route is matched and annotation `@Negotiation(default = true)` has provided default attribute. 

- `FallbackNegotiator` - The last one transformer. It's called when no other negotiator is matched.

### Transformers

These classes transform data formats from A to B.

- `JsonTransform` - The most used transformer, `entity` -> `json`.

- `JsonUnifyTransform` - Applied when the `unification` is enabled. Transformer, `entity` -> `json` (with formatted response).

- `CsvTransform` - Transform `entity` -> `csv`, but the entity must have an appropriate data.

- `RendererTransformer` - This is special transformer. If annotation `@Negotiation(renderer = App\Some\Class` has provided renderer attribute, 
this transformer receive that renderer, `entity` -> `renderer(entity)`.

## Playground

I've made a repository with full applications for education.
